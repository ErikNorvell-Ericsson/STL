test-iir.rme - Readme file for the test files for the IIR filter module
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
test-iir.rme:	This file
test-iir.zip:	ZIP-compatible archive with the test files in the Unix 
		byte orientation (high-byte first)
test-iir.sta:	ASCII file with statistics for the files below.
cascg712.ref:   IIR cascade-form G.712, 1:1, sf=8kHz [generated by c712demo]
iir-irs.ref:    IIR cascade-form IRS, 1:1, sf=8kHz [generated by irsdemo]
test.src:	Gaussian pseudo-noise test file.
testpcm1.ref:	IIR PCMDEMO parallel-form G.712 1:1, first stage of pcmdemo 
testpcmd.ref:	IIR PCMDEMO parallel-form G.712 2:1, first stage of pcmdemo 
testpcmu.ref:	IIR PCMDEMO parallel-form G.712 1:2, first stage of pcmdemo

Notes:
~~~~~~
- pcmdemo does not implement the IIR IRS filter, neither the cascade-form 
  G.712. It has been kept functionally identical to the STL92 pcmdemo.c
  
- files testpcm1.ref, testpcmd.ref, and testpcmu.ref are used
  to test both pcmdemo. File iir-irs.ref is used to test only irsdemo, and 
  file cascg712.ref is only used to test c712demo.c.

- automatic test procedure are available in the makefiles:
	make-vms.com - for VAX/VMS Vax-cc compiler or the VMS port of gcc
	makefile.bcc - for MSDOS Borland bcc
	makefile.djc - for MSDOS port of gcc
	makefile.unx - for Unix, using either cc, acc (Sun), or gcc

- all the binary files are in the Sun format (High-byte first), and to be
  used in VMS and MSDOS need to have every even and odd bytes swapped.

- the testpcm?.ref files have been generated from test.src for the reference
  implementation of the programs compiled by Sun's cc compiler. Files 
  cascg712.ref and iir-irs.ref were generated on a HP workstation using gcc.
  You may expect that running the program in other platforms may generate 
  files that are not identical, but that may have some different samples, 
  due to rounding errors. Therefore, expect errors in the range of +-1 
  when comparing the reference files and your processed ones.
